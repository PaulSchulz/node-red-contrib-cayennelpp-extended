# node-red-contrib-cayennelpp-extended
This work is based on [optionseven's node-red-contrib-cayennelpp](https://github.com/optionseven/node-red-contrib-cayennelpp), a node-red node that decodes cayennelpp encoded payload. The extensions are based on the work of [ElectronicCats](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/CayenneLPP), see lpp types in https://github.com/ElectronicCats/CayenneLPP/blob/master/decoders/decoder.js. I mainly worked on this to be able to use the extended lpp types in my node-red projects. I thank the creators above for their work.
The package is available at npm. You just do $ npm i node-red-contrib-cayennelpp-extended and restart node-red.
